# Revels-18
iOS Application For Revels-18. Developed With Swift.

One foot firmly rooted in our traditions. Another foot forward, towards a better future, marked by cleaner, and greener technology.
The Revels'18 logo brings these two concepts together. Moreover, the colours signify a concept each. The red leaf signifies wars, an integral part of our traditional history. The orange flame is allegorical to the most primal form of energy. The blue water droplet and the green leaf signify cleaner forms of energy such as hydro, tidal, and geothermal.
